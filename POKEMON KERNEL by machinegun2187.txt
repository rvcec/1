PROLOGUE: 
the game takes place in the pre-modern era where kings reigned (unlike classical pkmn games where it is set in the modern time), and many items in the classical games arent available in mine cuz they weren't invented yet (like pokeballs). it starts off with king Agin of Xyoras region, who travels around the world to find 8 "kernels" (certain objects of immense power), to conduct a particular ritual. according to the terms of the ritual, each member of one's family must hold one kernel in their hand. Agin realised there were only 7 members in his family, so he only required one more member to agree to the ritual's terms (8 kernels, one for each family member). so he conceives a child with a commoner, unbenownst to many ppl. thus he secretly slips a kernel into his newlyborn child's hand and hence the ritual starts. but for some reason the ritual went awfully wrong, unleashing the kernels' energy, and causing all people in the region to turn into pokemon. not only that, but the king mysteriously dies, and his 6 royal family members who participated in the ritual trasform into legendary pokemon (basically super-strong pkmn). these 6 guys become the main bosses of the game, and Agin himself becomes the final boss. this "concieved child" however transforms into a non-legendary pokemon though for some reason, unlike his relatives. this kid is our protagonist


BRIEF SUMMARY OF STORY (NEEDS REVIEWING):
	- protag starts his adventure
	- makes a friend who is added to the party
	- old lady tells us that protag, as the illegitimate royal family member, must retrieve back all kernels from the now-legendary pkmn, and undo the effects of the catastrophe by redoing that ritual
	- so we go on a quest to defeat all the bosses, gather more friends/party members and have multiple encounters "team thesis", who are a group of scientists, who are trying to develop a medicinal cure to revert the citizens of Xyoras back to their human forms
	- midway through the story we make a time travel machine and go back into the past to kill king agin just in time before his ritual starts, to hence prevent the catastrophe from ever happening. but due to the laws of time travel that "changing the past cannot change the future", meaning the catastrophe is inevitable, our team unintentionally happens to _cause_  the catastrophe (basically they poison agin's tea right before the ritual starts, causing him to die of poisoning right when the ritual is happening, making it a failure. ik this is super complicated)
	- we fight the 6th boss and get the final kernel. all that is left to do is use the royal family's blood (protag's blood) and do the ritual. it doesn't seem to work tho. hence we find out that protag isnt actually a royal family member
	- our team decides that it is best to resurrect Agin and use his blood to do the needful. agin wakes up, agrees to cooperate with us for the ritual, but he betrays us, manipulates the ritual to his favour, causing him to become arceus (the god of all pokemon). we fight him, and defeat him. before his death he tells us that the reason the first ritual failed was because he had accidentally given the 8th kernel to a different kid instead of his actual blood-related child. now his actual child named "walt" happens to be one among our party members who followed with us through most of the story. saying so, agin dies, and walt does the required ritual, restoring xyoras to its former order.
